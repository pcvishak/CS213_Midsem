First question - Part (a)   Sum of numbers
--------------------------------------------


0 marks if the solution is totally incorrect. 
5 marks if the student gets the Prutor test cases passed and also has a decent implementation
1 marks if the student does not get the Prutor test cases passed but has a decent implementation (close)
0 marks if the student does not get the Prutor test cases passed and does something weird or -
   			Copy pasted the code from any source.

Written : 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 (data structure -- vector/ array, purpose of the mathematical function -- finding the sum of the array, complexity of the algorithm & possible reduction -- O(N), yes, we can reduce if we use linear way but still O(N), is the code tail recursive?)

Total 10


First Question - Part (b)  Find two numbers that add up to given k
-------------------------------------------------------------------

0 marks if the solution is totally incorrect.
5 marks if all test cases are passed and also has a decent implementation.
3 marks if test cases failed, but close (minor fixes could get all the test cases passed)
1 mark  if test cases failed, but could get some test cases passed with minor fixes.

Written : ½ + ½  + 1 + 1 + 2
	   (Data structure used - 1 + Tail recursive (total of 1)
	    Running time - O(N), where N is the size of the input - 1
	    Purpose of the algorithm - Check if 2 elements in the list adds to ‘k’ 1 mark
	    Speed of algorithm: faster algorithm: Asymptotically not possible. 
Constant factor optimisations could be done - 2

Total marks 5 + 5 = 10

(Note : pasting code in the written part  = 0 for written
             1st qn without using recursion = 0)


Second question -- Doubly Linked List
----------------------------------------


0 marks if the solution is totally incorrect. 
6 marks if the student gets the Prutor test cases passed and also has a decent implementation
3 marks if the student makes mistakes in case like 1 1 2 1 1 (where he/she compares value match)
2 marks if the  student does not get the Prutor test cases passed but has a decent implementation (close)
0 marks if the  student does not get the Prutor test cases passed and does something weird (e.g. uses count and takes the gfk solution https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/write-a-c-function-to-print-the-middle-of-the-linked-list/)
1 + 1 for written solution - time is proportional to number of elements and space O(1)
Total 8


Third question - Mountain Stack
------------------------------------------------

0 marks if the solution is totally incorrect. 
10 marks if the student gets the Prutor test cases passed and also has a decent implementation
8 marks if the  student does not get the Prutor test cases passed  but has a decent implementation (close)
2 marks if the  student does not get the Prutor test cases passed  and does something weird (e.g. uses recursion and takes the gfk solution)

4 marks for written essay: 2 marks for why correct, 2 mark for time and space complexity (extra) (1 each)

4 marks for using array for correct implementation (code)

8: given output in reverse

4: given for reversing the stack

6: logic correct but code did not compile

4: logic close to correct. Like using 3 stacks and taking the two halves separately etc.
