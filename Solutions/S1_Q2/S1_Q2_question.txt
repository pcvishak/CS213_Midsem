Preamble (Meta Points):

Coding language: C++ or Python3
Goal:  Ability to understand recursion, problem solving, ability to read code and understand.
Difficulty: Medium
Note: We may add additional private cases after the exam concludes. So passing all test cases here does not guarantee full credits.

Written Questions:  See Inline.

Consider the following algorithm Q(A, i, j, k)

Input #1: An integer subset of an ordered sequence A of "n" integers with
indices i, and j (and 0 <= i <= j <= n-1)

Input #2: An integer k.

if i == j return false.
else
  if A[i] + A[j] < k then return Q(A, i+1, j, k)
  if A[i] + A[j] > k then return Q(A, i, j-1, k)
  if neither of the above return true.

Write a recursive function to implement the algorithm
What data structure did you use for A and why.
What is the running time of the algorithm. Explain.
What is the algorithm doing?  Explain.  Do you have a faster algorithm for the same problem
Is your code tail recursive? Explain.
