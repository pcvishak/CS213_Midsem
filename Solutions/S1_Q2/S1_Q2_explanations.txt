(b) Python list.
(c) O(n): Two pointers sweeping the array. Can prove inductively
(d) Finding if there are two elements in the ordered sequence summing up to k.
    Faster algorithm: Asymptotically not possible. Constant factor optimisations could be done.
(e) Yes, recursive calls are made at the end.
