Preamble (Meta Points)

Coding Language: C++
Provided: Singly Linked List
Constraints:  Cannot use any other data structure
Goal:  Ability to do basic programming.  (May reward people who have done this in some other course).
Note: We may add additional private cases after the exam concludes. So passing all test cases here does not guarantee full credits.

Task:

A 'taash' (Hindi for the normal playing cards) shuffle is a permutation of 2n items in a linked list where the first item in the permutation is a_0, the second is a_n, the third is a_1, the fourth is a_{n+1}, and so on.

Input: A linked list L1 with 2n data items as integers.
Output: A new linked list L2 which has the data items as a card shuffle

You are expected to code the function: std::list<int> shuffle(std::list<int> &L1). 
Note the case and spelling for the function name.
Your code should not modify the main function.
