Preamble (Meta Points)

Coding language: C++
Provided:  Stack
Goal:  Ability to do creative thinking and using concepts taught in a class about ADT. 

Written Questions: 
How do you show your algorithm is correct? Explain your method (no need for formal proof). 
What is the running time and memory space of your algorithm.


Input:  A sequence S of characters of unknown length (but always odd).

Constraints: 
Only data structure available is stack.  Linked list, array etc are all strictly forbidden
One counter variable is  allowed.  
Recursion is not permitted. 
Additional memory is permitted.


Task:

1. See code provided: It pushes the sequence S (available as input) onto a stack S. Note that the input is a sequence of odd no. of characters, and no ordering is available  i.e. we cannot say character a is less than character b.
2. Write more code.

Output:  The characters (after Step 2) are now in mountain order i.e. if S
contains  a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, with i on top of the stack after Step 1, then after
Step 2, S contains   f , g, h, i, e, d, c, b, a
Note that the relative position of the pivot element e is unchanged (it was in the middle and it remains in the same position.
